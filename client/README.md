# VisionAI Client App - Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Frontend

## 📌 Overview
The **VisionAI App Frontend** is a **Vue 3** application that provides a user-friendly interface for capturing, training, and detecting objects. It interacts with the **backend AI system**, which uses **TensorFlow.js** and **Pinecone** for machine learning and similarity search.

This application enables:
- **Camera Integration**: Start/stop a live video feed to capture images.
- **Training Mode**: Label and train images by sending them to the backend.
- **Detection Mode**: Capture an image, extract features, and identify objects using the backend model.
- **Logging & Debugging**: Uses `LoggerService` to track app events and errors.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/vision-app-client.git
cd vision-app-client
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies (**Using `pnpm`**)
This project uses **`pnpm`** as the package manager instead of `npm`. If you don’t have `pnpm` installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the **backend API URL**:

```
VITE_API_HOST=http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Application
To start the **Vue 3 frontend**, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start a **Vite development server**.  
By default, the application runs on **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**.

### 🔥 Benefits of Enhanced Logging
- **Easier Debugging**: Trace **exactly where** failures occur.
- **More Context in Logs**: `DEBUG` logs help inspect values.
- **Error Warnings**: Identifies non-critical issues (`WARN`).
- **Improved Error Handling**: Logs exact API request failures.

Now, **if the app misbehaves, you'll know why!** 🚀

## 📬 Conclusion
With this guide, you should be able to:
- Start the **Vue 3 frontend** with **Vite**.
- Capture images and interact with the **backend AI system**.
- Train and detect objects efficiently.
- Debug and log application events.

🚀 **Happy Coding!** 🎉
